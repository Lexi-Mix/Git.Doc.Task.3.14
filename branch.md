**Create a branch and switch to a branch**

```
git branch [name] - command that creates a new branch in the repository.
```

```
git checkout [name] is a command that switches you to a specific branch.
```

```
git checkout -b [name] - creates a new branch and switches you to it.
```

**Merging branches**

```
git merge [name] - absorption. Brings commits from another branch into the current one.
```

```
