Here are some rules for writing to a file .gitignore:

- An asterisk * replaces any number of characters (including zero). For example, the *.avi rule will ignore all files with an .avi extension;
- Question mark ? replaces any 1 character. Can be placed anywhere in the rule;
- Two asterisks ** are used to indicate any number of subdirectories. For example, alex/**/account.txt will ignore all files in the alex directory and all its subdirectories;
- Exclamation point ! at the beginning of the line means the rule is inverted;
- The \ character is used to escape special characters;
- The / character is used to separate the directory level.
